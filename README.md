## An example project demonstrating a bug descripted in issue #31

As you can see, typing works fine, so do the styles of text. However, the numbered and bullet lists don't work.

### Tested on macOS 12.6.8, on browsers:
 - Google Chrome	119.0.6045.199
 - Firefox 120.0
 - Safari 15.6.1

 Let me know how things look on Windows or maybe pure React, wihtout Next.js

Cheers,
M
